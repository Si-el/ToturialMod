### Minecraft mod made by following a toturial by "Kaupenjoe", it is just made for me to add a bunch of items and try things, so everything is available.

The textures, some were made by me mixing certain textures, and randomly putting colors everywhere, while others come from this amazing github repository:
https://github.com/malcolmriley/unused-textures
They're all free, you should use it too!
